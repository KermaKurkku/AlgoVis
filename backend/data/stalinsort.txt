Stalin sort is one of the most effective sorting algorithms created by gustavo-depaula on github. It is one of the only single pass sorting algorithms, meaning it sorts the list with only a single pass through the list.
The algorithm works by iterating through the list and checking if the elements are in order. Any element found not to be in order is eliminated.
The algorithm's complexity is always O(n), where n is the amount of items in the list.

#Pseudocode

//StalinSort(A[])//	n := A.length//	bigger := 0//	B SET empty list////	for i := 0 to n do://		if A[i] >= bigger://			bigger := A[i]//			B.push(A[i])//		end if//	end for////	return B

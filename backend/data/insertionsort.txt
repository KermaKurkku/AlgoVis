Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that steps through the given list and checks if the items are in order. If the items are out of order, the algorithm moves the smaller element down the list until it is in order.
Insertion sort is not often used for real world applications as it's average complexity is O(n²), n being the amount of items in the list, which means the number of iterations grow's exponentially as the size of the list grows.

Pseudocode implementation

//	i ← 1//	while i < length(A)//		j ← i//		while j > 0 and A[j-1] > A[j]//			swap A[j] and A[j-1]//			j ← j - 1//		end while//		i ← i + 1//	end while
